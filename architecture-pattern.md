## Architectural styles

An architectural style, sometimes called an architectural pattern, is a set of principlesâ€”a coarse grained pattern that provides an abstract framework for a family of systems. An architectural style improves partitioning and promotes design reuse by providing solutions to frequently recurring problems. You can think of architecture styles and patterns as sets of principles that shape an application.

Architecture style | Description
----|----
Client/Server | Segregates the system into two applications, where the client makes requests to the server. In many cases, the server is a database with application logic represented as stored procedures.
Component-Based Architecture | Decomposes application design into reusable functional or logical components that expose well-defined communication interfaces.
Domain Driven Design | An object-oriented architectural style focused on modeling a business domain and defining business objects based on entities within the business domain.
Layered Architecture | Partitions the concerns of the application into stacked groups (layers).
Message Bus | An architecture style that prescribes use of a software system that can receive and send messages using one or more communication channels, so that applications can interact without needing to know specific details about each other.
N-Tier / 3-Tier | Segregates functionality into separate segments in much the same way as the layered style, but with each segment being a tier located on a physically separate computer.
Object-Oriented | A design paradigm based on division of responsibilities for an application or system into individual reusable and self-sufficient objects, each containing the data and the behavior relevant to the object.
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) | Refers to applications that expose and consume functionality as a service using contracts and messages.

The following table lists the major areas of focus and the corresponding architectural styles.

Category | Architecture styles
---|---
Communication | Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Message Bus
Deployment | Client/Server, N-Tier, 3-Tier
Domain | Domain Driven Design
Structure | Component-Based, Object-Oriented, Layered Architecture
